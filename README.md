# TokenGet
TokenGet is a tool to intercept Samsung Pay tokens using a credit card reader and a raspberry zero.

You must edit the email from hotmail and the password of the account.

To run the *.py after raspberry zero boots up automatically, you have to add a line of code at the end of /etc/profile file: 

sudo nano /etc/profile

go to the end and add:

sudo python ~/TokenGet.py

depending where you saved your TokenGet.py file.
