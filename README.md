# TokenGet
TokenGet is a tool to intercept Samsung Pay tokens using a credit card reader and a raspberry zero.

To run the *.py when raspberry zero boots up, you have to add a line of code to the /etc/profile file
like this: 
sudo nano /etc/profile

go to the last line and add it

sudo python ~/TokenGet.py

depending where you saved your TokenGet.py file.
